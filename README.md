# VRDC-systems

This is a repository for systems developed for use by VR Drone Club. Come visit us over at [our discord](https://discord.gg/KnYKVVUJJd)

As of 3/26/2025, this project is just barely beginning and the initial structure is being built. This will primarily involve Udonsharp scripts built for use within VRChat worlds to interact with the newly released VRC Camera Drone.
